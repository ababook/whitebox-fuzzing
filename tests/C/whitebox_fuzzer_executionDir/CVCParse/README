This CVC parser is written to parse the CVC file generated by BAP. 
Since the BAP will put multiple real CVC assertions togother in one single file, we need to split the file and create multiple CVC file for each assertion.

CVCParser is used to fulfill that requirement.
SolverResultExtractor is added to extract STP solver result and generate new inputs.


Source code is under ./src directory and class file is under ./bin directory.
